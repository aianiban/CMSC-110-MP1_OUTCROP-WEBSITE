      <h1>SOVEREIGNTY NOT FOUND</h1>
      <p>The only means to keep the country’s dominion to rule and control its own is at stake – that is how to conclude the current state of Philippine sovereignty today. Daily news remind Filipinos of how their sovereignty is shaken; how their government cannot rely and prioritize their own kind in terms of manpower and employment, and how they cannot keep a firm hold to their own territory – the West Philippine Sea.</p><p>
Different tactics and the growing influence of China in global affairs show how they are eager to advance to achieve the superpower status and Duterte’s actions evasively indicate how he could gamble Philippine independence just to be part of this narrative.
The deemed to be “friendly” relation with China kicked off with the presence of
Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea. Artificial island and military outpost by China are built in the sandbar between the Pag-asa and Zamora (Subi) Reef. It is not just their presence which pose threats to the country’s sovereignty, but China trying to gain authority and control over the Philippine territory.</p><p>
Recently, the story of how a Chinese vessel rammed a small fishing boat carrying 22 Filipino fishermen and left them in the middle of the sea circled the news and social media. The only response they got from the government was silence and not even a hint of defense. The government even had the audacity to silence the fishermen and give them run-of-the-mill boats that were visibly incapable to navigate around the West Philippine Sea.</p><p>
While the local fisher folks are struggling to make a living in their small boats, they
are being casted out by these Chinese nationals who engulf the sea on their large ships to exploit and damage the marine environment of the West Philippine Sea. Moreover, according to the Commission on Filipinos Overseas, 311 hectares of coral reefs have been built by China as part of their reclamation activities. All of which are a clear violation of Philippine’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction under the international law as stated in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p><p>
In line with the government’s relation to China, Duterte’s “Build Build Build” project is set to make a massive infrastructure overhaul all over the country. In order to fund the project, the government has agreed several loan agreements with China. According to the Department of Finance, over ₱380 billion in soft loans and grants were pledged by China for large-scale projects in the Philippines.</p><p>
Among the projects that will be funded by the loan agreement is the New Centennial Water Source - Kaliwa Dam in Infanta, Quezon Province which would cost around ₱12 billion, the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project in Cagayan Province worth ₱3.7 billion, and the Philippine National Railways South Long Haul Railway in North Luzon which will cost ₱149 billion.</p><p>
Within the agreements of these projects, however, are high interest rates and provisions seemingly waiving off the country’s sovereign immunity. These loan agreementsmight well be part of the Chinese debt trap. Once the government fails to pay off its debt to China, the country might end up just like Sri Lanka who have handed a major port to China as payment.</p><p>
Business relations with China sounds like the Philippines have lost its trust on its own manpower. With 3.8 millions of recorded unemployed Filipinos as of July 2018, employing Chinese nationals in the country is deemed unnecessary. The influx of Chinese workers in the country is due to the failed regulation of Philippine Online Gambling Operations (POGOs), they argued that they need to hire Chinese because they speak the language of the casino patrons.</p><p>
Department of Labor and Employment records show that there are 2,884 Chinese nationals working in construction. The Build, Build, Build project promised employment opportunities for the Filipinos, but as part of the loan agreements with China, Chinese nationals were once again prioritized by the government. According to the guidelines for the issuance of Special Working Permits, foreign nationals can only be employed only if any Filipino cannot perform the work.</p><p>
Hiring foreign nationals do not do any good, it just deprives Filipinos of job
opportunities in their own country; leaving them with no choice, but to go overseas.</p><p>
Moreover, there are 100,000 to 250,000 Chinese nationals who are illegally employed in the country. This does not only mean taking away job opportunities, but also a loss ingovernment income. While many Filipinos opt to go overseas, contractualization and unfair labor conditions still exist; it is unlikely and unreasonable to open the country for foreign labor force.</p><p>
Duterte is fooling the Filipino with the false pretense that the so-called “friendship” with China promises economic growth and progress to the country. The Philippines’ sovereignty is clearly under threat and its own president is reluctant in defending it for its people. It is quite ironic how Duterte acts tough towards Filipinos who dare go against him yet instantly become tongue-tied when it comes to confronting those that oppress the Filipino people.</p><p>
The Philippines should be for the Filipinos, not for the Chinese, Americans or anyoneelse. Filipinos are not anyone’s slave. If Duterte will not fight for Philippine sovereignty, there is no one left but the Filipinos themselves who will fight for genuine independence and sovereignty.

      <h1>NEVER BE SILENCED</h1>
      <p>Throughout history, from the journalist-propagandists of the La Solidaridad who reported on the political and economic conditions of the country during the Spanish period, the early student publications that established the College Editors Guild of the Philippines, to the journalists and media outfits censored during the Martial Law era, the press has always stood against repression.
Today, attacks on media and press freedom continue to threaten our democracy.</p><p>
The most recent attack on press freedom under the Duterte administration manifests in the arrest of Rappler CEO and executive director Maria Ressa. She was apprehended for alleged cyber-libel over an article written and published in May 2012, four months before the enactment of the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p><p>
Ressa’s case is not an isolated case, rather it is just another puzzle piece added to the orchestrated attacks by the administration against its resistors.
Duterte has been openly skeptical of how the media writes about the administration, and has started chastising the media even before he assumed presidency. Furthermore, he stated that the Philippine media is governed by corrupt journalists.</p><p>
His position as the president now gives him more power to threaten and harass those who play a big part in educating, informing, and shaping public opinion.</p><p>
Duterte’s administration is known for the rampant spreading of fake news. It is no surprise that he targeted those who strive to fight against fake news. Rappler, for example, is one of Facebook’s fact-checkers in the Philippines. </p><p>
His administration also attacks those who expose his “troll army” or those who dole out fake news. Most of all, he is quick to silence those who oppose or criticize his war on drugs.</p><p>
Journalists and media practitioners also face the issue of red-tagging. Efforts are being made by the government to link them to the communist revolutionary movement. </p><p>
Recently, members of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) were accused of being part of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New People’s Army (NPA), and the National Democratic Front (NDF). </p><p>
This downright political vilification of our journalists is a testament of how our current administration treats the press.
The government is hell-bent on silencing its critics. It’s ironic how Duterte uses the law to undermine those who oppose him but he himself disregards one of the basic rights of the Filipino people. </p><p>
Although it is indicated in the Philippine Constitution that freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press shall not be deprived, the current administration still continues these attacks abridging people’s rights to tell the truth behind the facade that the administration puts up. </p><p>
In light of these unending attacks by the Duterte administration on press freedom, journalists and media practitioners should lead the fight to defend it. The writers of UPB Outcrop stand by these calls to stop the harassment of the press.</p><p>
As journalists, it is our responsibility to expose these injustices done by the government to the masses. This is no simple task especially when the current administration continues to attack whoever tries to go against, or at the very least, dare to question them. 
Nevertheless, our fight must go on - the press should never be silenced.

      <h1>KNOWING THE SYMPTOM</h1>
      <p>Three years ago a new president was proclaimed as the new commander-in-chief of the Republic of the Philippines. This president is someone many Filipinos voted for as they got tired of traditional politicians whose main credential is being the child of past politicians. He promised to rule with an iron fist to tackle the problems of drugs and corruption that plague the Philippines. However, these problems are merely symptoms of an underlying and deep-rooted problem that permeate and promulgated by the current system.</p><p>
Duterte’s war on drugs, a campaign he launched to tackle the supposed drug problem of the country, continues up to this day under the guise of different names such as Oplan Tokhang and Oplan Double Barrel reloaded. This war did not solve the country’s drug problem, but rather left thousands of Filipinos lifeless in blood-stained streets lifeless; a war which left thousands of Filipinos orphaned.</p><p>
Not long after, the president decided to impose martial law in Mindanao, instigated by the siege in Marawi. However, months after the Marawi siege, with the help of his cronies inside the House of representatives, Senate, and Supreme Court, the president extended martial law in Mindanao. Its implementation, contrary to its supposed task to establish order, is riddled with human rights abuses committed by the very institution who swore to serve and protect the Filipino people. Martial law in the Philippines is not an isolated incident in Mindanao --the whole archipelago is haunted by the specter of undeclared martial law.</p><p>
Undeclared martial law, or de facto martial law, is evident through various programs implemented by the state. This breach of human rights is felt by majority of the Filipino people, especially those who are part of the lower class. Workers who are peacefully protesting within their picket lines are continuously met with force and harassment as they fight for national industrialization. Farmers and agricultural workers who till unproductive lands to produce crops that would sustain their everyday life are met with guns and harassment by state forces as they fight for genuine agrarian reform. Activists and human rights defenders are continuously tagged as terrorists subjecting them to harassment that could lead to unwanted arrests or, worse, death. It is ironic that those who risk their lives everyday to fight for the rights and welfare of the masses, are the ones who do not enjoy what they are fighting for. </p><p>
It must be realized that martial law, declared or not, is not the main problem that plagues the Philippine society. It is merely a symptom of decades-long oppression that continues to spread and is further disseminated by the current fascist system.</p><p>
It is important that we, Outcrop, help expose these narratives to the student body, and to the Filipino people. We believe that the issues of the students are issues of the Filipino people as well. It is imperative that we participate in actions that aim to tackle national issues. Also, it is our role and responsibility as Iskolars ng Bayan to not limit ourselves to the fight of the student sector, but rather be one with the broad masses in their fight for their democratic rights.
