      <div class="headline">Filipinos stand firm in regaining control over West Philippine Sea</div>
      <h5>// Isagani M. Caspe</h5>
      <p>China has continued to terrorize our countrymen and seeks to endanger further our sovereignty but Filipinos stand against the domination of our sea.</p><p>

The United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) acknowledges the fact hat Scarborough Shoal falls within the 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEC) of the Philippines. Clearly, Filipinos hold the sole rights to all the maritime resources of the island. </p><p>
However, since the standoff incident between the Chinese and Philippine vessels in Scarborough Shoal in 2012, China dominated West Philippine Sea. They started to develop bases on the island, deploy fighter jets to other military facilities they constructed, built bunkers, shelters, radar and signalling systems that still operate until today.</p><p>
Few months after the standoff incident, agreement had been done for both countries to pull out. The Philippines pulled out, China did not. They stayed in our sea and ended up in control.</p><p>
In January 2013, former President Benigno Aquino decided to file a case against them. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated that China was no legal basis to claim the rights to resources in the sea areas falling within the nine-dash line. </p><p>
But China’s arbitral ruling is unshakeable. They reiterated that part of their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEC) is the West Philippine Sea; hence, they will not recognize the result of the arbitration.</p><p>
Then, in 2016, there was a bilateral agreement between China and the Philippines under the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. This gave the Filipino fishermen the “imaginary” freedom to benefit from the maritime resources in the West Philippine Sea, with theChina coast guards patrolling the water.</p><p>
When Rodrigo Duterte assumed as the President of the Philippines, he established a strong political bond with China, the one who used and abused our own maritime resources. </p><p>Despite having friendly ties with Chinese government, stories of exploitation not just in our resources but also to our people remain. </p><p>According to fishermen in Masinloc Zambales, the privilege given by the agreement does not really apply in Scarborough Shoal, because down there none of those matters – Chinese rule. </p><p>They are also prohibited to use large boats inside thelagoon of the Island, only small boats can fish inside because at the entrance of the island, vessels of China are guarding.</p><p>
Fishermen in Scarborough Shoal reported that the Chinese coast guards boarded their boat, opened their storage, take the best of their catch without permission, then they leave as soon as they have their fill.</p><p>
Recently, China violated Article 98 of the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which directs that, every state is required to render assistance to any person in distress or in danger of being lost at sea. </p><p>They abandoned 22 Filipino seafarers in the Reed Bankafter the Chinese and Philippine vessels’ collision incident.</p>

      <h5>// Mecy Siteg</h5>
        <p>Contrary to lawless violence suppression, the implementation of Memorandum Order No. 32 has resulted to the spike of human rights abuses and relentless attacks towards human rights defenders.</p><p>

The MO 32 was issued last November 22, deploying additional forces from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to suppress lawlessness violence and acts of terror in Samar, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental and Bicol.</p><p>
The Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, however, warned that MO 32 will only give further authority to the AFP and PNP to carry out red-tagging of activists, illegal arrests and detentions and military encampment in communities in the said provinces.</p><p>
The National Federation of Peasant Women (Amihan) also reported that the deployment of nine army battalions in Eastern Visayas affected 545 villages forcing evacuations in San Jorge, Calbiga, Las Navas, San Jose De Buan and Pinabacdao including aerial bombings in Matuginao and Las Navas.</p><p>
In addition, the military operations of the 87 th Infantry Battalion of the 8 th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army have forcibly evacuated 1,409 from their communities in Barangays Hagbay, San Nicolas, Can-ponte and San Pedro in San Juan de Buan, Samar on March 8 and 17 to 26.</p><p>
Eleven regular and special battalions are also operating in Negros and at least 68 were killed and more than 70 were illegally arrested and detained while 62 individuals were killed in Bicol region including human rights activists’ Bagasala, Hubilla and Morada.</p><p>
The National Democratic Front of the Philippines also criticized MO 32 and said that it is President Duterte’s ground work for nationwide martial law to prolong his cling to power while the Alliance for the Advancement of People’s Rights (KARAPATAN) stated that it is an additional directive to kill and militarize targeted communities.</p><p>
However, Department of National Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and DILG Secretary
Eduardo Año both dismissed claims that MO 32 will be the prelude for declaring nationwide martial law while the AFP and PNP also said that they do not have the intention to support its imposition.</p><p>
Conversely, Senator Leila de Lima condemned the killings of human rights workers and said that the continued harassment against President Duterte’s critics is aimed at silencing those who bravely stand up against the oppressive acts of the current administration and also stressed that Filipinos should not
remain blind and deaf to the plight of their fellow countrymen who lost their loved ones to Duterte’s bloody war against illegal drugs and the rampant abuse of power under the current administration.</p><p>
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea signed MO 32 upon the order of President Duterte amid the &quot;sporadic acts of violence” in the said provinces which were allegedly committed by lawless groups.</p>

      <div class="headline">Workers pursue the fight to end contractualization despite Digong’s dismissal of Anti-Endo</div>
      <h5>// Kricel Marianne Grace Garcillan</h5>
        <p>President Rodrigo Duterte vetoed the anti-endo bill in the middle of continuous strikes organized by different progressive labor unions on July 26.</p><p>
Last November, BCPO city The bill would have fulfilled his campaign promise 3 years ago to end contractualization and other abuses experienced by the workforce if passed to a law.</p><p>
“Between labor’s demand to end Endo and the employer’s call to veto it, President Duterte seems bent on surrendering on the capitalist blackmail,” said Rene Magtubo, Partido Manggagawa National Chair.Alan Tanjusay from Associated Labor Unions - Trade Union Congress of the Philippines(TUCP), also emphasized that Duterte’s dismissal of the bill is a non-fulfillment of hiscampaign promise which also manifests, that his turning his back away from the workers.</p><p>
On the other hand, the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECP) agrees withthe president’s decision saying it would have been disastrous for the economy if the bill was pursued.</p><p>
“It’s a superfluous bill considering that the President has already delivered what he promised before, that he will end Endo,” said Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr., President, ECP.</p><p>
Ortiz-Luis pertains to executive order no. 51, which was signed by the president on may 2018, aiming to implement article 106 of the labor code of the Philippines, but this was deemed useless by labor groups aws it only reiterates the labor code.</p><p>
Meanwhile, Senator Joel Villanueva, sponsor of Security of Tenure (SOT) Bill, refiled the SOT Bill in senate and TUCP partylist will also be refilling the measure to the house of representatives.</p><p>
“We are expected to rise above politics to favor the powerless and do what is just. Most of the time, those in the corridors of power win [but] we will persevere until we see that no worker will involuntarily lose his or her job because of contractualization,” said Villanueva.</p><p>
Moreover, according to Department of Labor and Employment, the added expense of 49 billion pesos to the employers that the ECP claims is actually part of the workers’ benefits which is an obligation of the employers in the first place.</p><p>
The TUCP now calls for the President to certify the SOT Bill as urgent. They also appeal to him to listen to the workers’ cry in fighting their rights and to ignore the misleading andscaremongering that some of his economic managers and foreign and local businessmenhave put around Endo bill.</p>

      </div>
      <h5>// Kate Paulyn Tayco</h5>
        <p>Nasubok ang pakikiisa ng 642 na mga bagong iskolar ng bayan ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas Baguio (UPB) sa pagtindig laban sa mga isyung kinahaharap ng bayan sa sunod-sunod na mga kilos-protesta sa kanilang unang linggo sa unibersidad.</p><p>
Sa naganap na Freshman Welcome Orientation sa bagong gawang Himnasyo Amianan noong ika-5 ng Agosto, pinangunahan ni Nationalist Corps Head Perine Agraviador ang lightning rally kung saan  hinamon niya ang mga freshman na tumindig para sa bayan.</p><p>
Ilan sa mga itinampok na isyu ni Agraviador ay ang problema sa edukasyon tulad na lamang ng Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 20 o ang pag-alis ng wika at panitikan bilang core courses sa kolehiyo.</p><p>
Nabigyang diin din ang Memorandum Order No. 32 na naglalayong magtalaga ng mga dagdag na tauhan ng Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) sa Bicol, Samar, at Isla ng Negros upang bawasan ang bilang ng mga karahasan na di umano ay gawa ng mga “lawless groups.”</p><p>
Kaugnay nito, naging malakas ang panawagan ng mga progresibong grupo at Konseho ng mag-aaral sa UPB sa mga bagong iskolar na makiisa sa mga kampanya laban sa mga isyu na kinahaharap ng masa. </p><p>
Naglunsad din ng kilos-protesta sa kantina ng UPB sa unang araw ng mga bagong iskolar ng bayan bilang pakikiisa sa malawakang First Day Fight sa buong UP System upang sila ay himukin sa paglaban sa mga isyung kinakaharap ng bansa.</p><p>
Dagdag pa rito, naging mainit din ang pagsalubong sa unang linggo ng mga bagong iskolar ng bayan sa UPB matapos ang insidente ng pagbaril sa paralegal volunteer ng Cordillera Human Rights Alliance (CHRA) at Provincial Human Rights Officer ng Ifugao na si Brandon Lee noong ika-6 ng Agosto.</p><p>
Kaugnay nito, nag-organisa ng Indignation Rally ang mga progresibong grupo sa Cordillera upang kondenahin ang naging pag-atake kay Lee sa sarili nilang bahay.</p><p>
“Sa una, kinilabutan ako dahil unang beses kong makakita ng mga kilos-protesta na laging binabalita ng mga midya pero simula ng dumalo ako sa EDs [Educational Discussions] at iba pa, doon ko nalaman na may mga ipinaglalaban pala ang UPB para sa masa na sa tingin ko ay ipaglalaban ko rin bilang bagong iskolar,” pahayag ni Bryan Dominic Agor, isa sa mga bagong iskolar ng bayan mula sa Kolehiyo ng Agham Panlipunan.

        <p>Students who went ‘missing’ refuted Senator Ronald Dela Rosa’s claim that they were ‘brainwashed’ and ‘kidnapped’ after being recruited by leftist organizations.</p><p>
‘
brainwashed’ and ‘kidnapped’ after being recruited by leftist organizations.</p><p>
The Senate probe regarding the supposed disappearance of students lead by Senator Dela Rosa, the head of Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, was conducted last August 7. </p><p>Parents of the ‘missing’ students appeared before the hearing. They claimed that their children joined leftist organizations and went missing afterwards.</p><p>
Alicia Lucena, a student of Far Eastern University and one of the ‘missing’ students, posted a statement on her Facebook account testifying that she was not kidnapped nor recruited by the CPP-NPA.</p><p>
“I joined Anakbayan voluntarily, I was never coerced to do things na hindi ko gusto o gumawa ng bagay na beyond sa aking pagpapasya. It’s really painful and outrageous na inaaccuse ako, kami, nila Bato at ng mga cohorts ni Duterte na “brainwashed”. Hindi yan totoo.” </p><p>Lucena wrote on her Facebook statement after the Senate probe linked her organization as a part of the CPP-NPA.</p><p>
The second hearing on the issue conducted was held on August 14. Four rebel returnees testified during the hearing narrating their experiences of joining organizations and eventually leading to the NPA.</p><p>
Organizations involved such as Anakbayan, League of Filipino Students and Kabataan Partylist immediately condemned the Senate probe in a press conference last August 12. They claimed that it is a form of harassment towards youth activists and progressive organizations.</p><p>
“The Duterte regiume can no longer hide its true colors as anti-youth and anti-people, which is why it resorts to shaming and discrediting progressive groups, and maligning the just demands of a growing number of Filipinos who are fed-up and eager to oust his fascist regime.” </p><p>Anakbayan National spokesperson, Alex Danday said in a press release condemning the senate probe on missing activists.</p>

      <h5>// Kricel Marianne Grace Garcillan</h5>
        <p>Baguio jeepney drivers strengthen their fight against Public Utility Vehicle Modernization program (PUVMP) after the Department of Transportation Cordillera (DOTr Car) confirms that the program will push through, August 23.</p><p>
Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide  (Piston) Baguio-Benguet organizes meetings with jeepney drivers from different areas to talk about their propose action against PUVMP and to unify their voices in disagreement to the program. They also held a dialogue with government officials to extend their contentions.</p><p>
“We, in the transport sector, are against PUVMP because it is stated under the guidelines that our individual franchise would be revoked in which small operators and drivers will be at disadvantage,” said Lito Wayas, Piston Baguio-Benguet, President.</p><p>
Moreover, Wayas explained that the government requires them to form cooperatives wherein, they would have one route, one operator and one franchise. As such, an operator or independent jeepney drivers would have to consolidate to form one fleet which would cause the eventual revocation of their individual franchise.</p><p>
“The problem with forming cooperatives is that it is an onerous thing to do and is costly specially to small operators. And even if we consolidate to form one fleet the cost per unit of a modern jeep which is about 1.6-2.4 million pesos is still inaccessible for us,” Wayas added.</p><p>
Meanwhile, Piston Baguio-Benguet already passed a position paper to DOTr Car highlighting their sentiments on the program and suggesting a more feasible solution considering their financial capabilities on pursuing the goal of PUVMP.</p><p>
Wayas said that on their position paper they proposed to rehabilitate jeeps to be road worthy as defined under PUVMP instead of completely scrapping old jeepneys because buying new ones would be more expensive. He also emphasized that the government should also consider the terrain of Baguio since the new vehicles are not made for steep roads.</p><p>
Furthermore, disadvantages of PUVMP will not just be felt by the transport sector but also by regular commuters as operators are required to have a minimum of 15 modern jeep units and considering the price of each units means that they will have to regain their investments by increasing the minimum fare.</p><p>
PUVMP is a flagship program of the Duterte Administration which aims to provide a modern, well-managed and environmentally sustainable transport sector. It includes, modernized public utility vehicles and sets of new guidelines stated in a web post by Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board.</p><p>
However, the transport sector strictly opposes the program deeming it as anti-poor development project thus Piston will be holding a nationwide united transport protest action on September 30 as a response to the approval of PUVMP.</p>
